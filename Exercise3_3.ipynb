        "The coordinates of all the stations are separated into two lists (`lat` and `lon`) and the names of the stations are in the `stations` list. From these lists, you would get, for example, the location of the first station by combining the latitude and longitude coordinates from the coordinate lists, and the name of that station from the `stations` list at index `0`.\n",

        "    - Hint: You should create a loop that iterates `n` times. Create a variable *`n`* that should contain the number of stations we have here.\n",
        "    - You should use a conditional statement to find out if the latitude coordinate of a station is either North or South of the center point of Sweden (`59.35, 15.2`) **AND** if the longitude location is West or East of that center point.\n",
